# Redpanda Field Guides

Welcome, brave adventurer! Here you'll find lessons on how to implement the features of [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com) with technical demos you can run on your own systems.

The information in this repository goes along with the [Redpanda Field Guides](https://university.redpanda.com/redpanda-field-guides) course at the [Redpanda University](https://university.redpanda.com). Go there for free education on streaming fundamentals, Redpanda, and more.

Did I mention that it's free?

The Field Guides are designed to supplement [the docs](https://docs.redpanda.com), and the docs are _always_ the source of truth. Start there to understand the concepts, and go to [Redpanda University](https://university.redpanda.com) for guides on how to work with Redpanda out in the wild.
